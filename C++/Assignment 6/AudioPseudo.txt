1. The first thing that the script should do is to summon a GUI menu
to give all of the options for the program.
-Starting with the 3 function stubs, it should give the option to do 
the 1. Audio Echo, 2. Compress, 3. fftBar whatever that last one is.

2. In the cases for the GUI menu, we should see in case 1
that it runs the Audio Echo function
3. Case 2 for the GUI menu should summon the Compress function
4. Case 3 should summon the fftBar function
